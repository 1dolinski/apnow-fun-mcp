# MCP Server Setup Tool

This is a setup tool to help developers quickly install and configure MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. MCP is a powerful protocol that enables AI-assisted development, and this tool aims to make it easier for developers to get started with MCP servers.

## What is MCP?
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol for extending AI capabilities through local servers. This setup tool provides a quick way to bootstrap an MCP server with common tools and configurations. For more information about MCP itself, please visit the official documentation.
